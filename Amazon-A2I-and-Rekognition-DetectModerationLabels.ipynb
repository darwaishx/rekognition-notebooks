    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I) makes it easy to build the workflows required for human review of ML predictions. Amazon A2I brings human review to all developers, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with building human review systems or managing large numbers of human reviewers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon A2I provides built-in human review workflows for common machine learning use cases, such as content moderation and text extraction from documents, which allows predictions from Amazon Rekognition and Amazon Textract to be reviewed easily. You can also create your own workflows for ML models built on Amazon SageMaker or any other tools. Using Amazon A2I, you can allow human reviewers to step in when a model is unable to make a high confidence prediction or to audit its predictions on an on-going basis. Learn more here: https://aws.amazon.com/augmented-ai/\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will show how you can use Amazon A2I directly within your API calls to Amazon Rekognition's Detect Moderation Labels API. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more in depth instructions, visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-getting-started.html"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "To incorporate Amazon A2I into your human review workflows, you need three resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **worker task template** to create a worker UI. The worker UI displays your input data, such as documents or images, and instructions to workers. It also provides interactive tools that the worker uses to complete your tasks. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-instructions-overview.html\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **human review workflow**, also referred to as a flow definition. You use the flow definition to configure your human workforce and provide information about how to accomplish the human review task. For built-in task types, you also use the flow definition to identify the conditions under which a review human loop is triggered. For example, with Amazon Rekognition can perform image content moderation using machine learning. You can use the flow definition to specify that an image will be sent to a human for content moderation review if Amazon Rekognition's confidence score output is low for your use case. You can create a flow definition in the Amazon Augmented AI console or with the Amazon A2I APIs. To learn more about both of these options, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-create-flow-definition.html\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **human loop** to start your human review workflow. When you use one of the built-in task types, the corresponding AWS service creates and starts a human loop on your behalf when the conditions specified in your flow definition are met or for each object if no conditions were specified. When a human loop is triggered, human review tasks are sent to the workers as specified in the flow definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a custom task type, you start a human loop using the Amazon Augmented AI Runtime API. When you call StartHumanLoop in your custom application, a task is sent to human reviewers."
